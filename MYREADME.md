# Challenges

- Having a challenge on how to do the comment on line 47. Not sure if I do not understand the comment corretly or not.
- I came accross a border feauture that uses the before and after pseudo elements and a calc funtion but did not figure it out, so that is something that i still need to go and work a lot on.

* feature I am proud about is the animation button, because I figured that out even though it is a bit basic..
